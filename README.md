Additional Notes:
I got stuck when undoing items inside the Prototype cell and keep receieving a Thread error about unable to dequeue "tweetCell". I fixed this error after hours of trial and error but some of the code perhaps got removed when I undo my work hence why the data and formating of the cells looked incomplete. I'm gonna push my code more often to avoid app-breaking errors halting my progress.
